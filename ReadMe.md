## How long did you spend on this project?

I spent around 6 hours splitting up the work for a 5 days.

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?

1) Click events on the recycler view could have been implemented 
2) Employee Summary screen where we can check the complete information about the employees
3) THe app makes the API call everytime when swipe refreshing the Directory screen. THis could have been avoided

1) Actual API calls made every time the user swipe refreshes the screen.
